# Goldman Sachs Software Engineering Virtual Experience Task

This repository contains the results of a password cracking exercise performed on a password dump file. The aim of the exercise was to assess the type of hashing algorithm used, the level of protection offered for the passwords, the possible controls that could be implemented to prevent successful cracking, and the organization's password policy.

# Contents

The repository contains the following files:

Password cracking report - A detailed report of the findings and conclusions of the password cracking exercise.

# How to use

To view the results of the password cracking exercise, simply clone the repository and open the password cracking report file. The report provides a comprehensive analysis of the results and includes information on the type of hashing algorithm used, the level of protection offered, the possible controls that could be implemented, the organization's password policy, and proposed changes to the policy.

# Background

This exercise was part of an internship task for Goldman Sachs, which required the intern to crack as many passwords as possible using available tools (e.g. Hashcat) and to provide a draft email/memo explaining the findings and conclusions of the analysis.

# Note

Please note that the password dump file is not included in the repository for security reasons. The results and conclusions presented in the password cracking report are based on a fictional password dump file
